# Data Integration with Pandas and PySpark

This repository provides Python code for integrating data from various sources using the Pandas library for data manipulation and PySpark for distributed processing.

## Overview

Data integration is a critical process in data analysis and machine learning projects. It involves combining data from different sources, such as CSV files and JSON files, to create a unified dataset for analysis.

This project demonstrates how to perform data integration using a combination of Pandas and PySpark. Pandas is used for data manipulation on a single machine, while PySpark enables distributed processing across multiple machines.

## Requirements

Before running the code in this repository, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Process

The data integration process consists of the following steps:

1. **Reading Data**: Data is read from multiple sources using Pandas and PySpark.

2. **Data Transformation**: Data may undergo transformation steps, such as cleaning and preprocessing, to prepare it for integration.

3. **Merging Data**: Data from different sources is merged based on common keys or columns to create a unified dataset.

4. **Persisting Data**: The integrated data is stored in a database or file system for further analysis or use.

## Usage

1. **Data Integration Script**: The `cleanup_analysis.ipynb` script demonstrates how to integrate data from various sources using Pandas and PySpark. Follow the instructions in the script to customize it for your specific data sources and requirements.

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: The `cleanup_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide to cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the integrated data. Execute the cells sequentially to perform data analysis tasks.

3. **Ingestion Process**: The `main.py` script demonstrates how to ingest the integrated data into a PostgreSQL database using PySpark. Adjust the database connection parameters and table name according to your environment.
